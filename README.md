# Openstack-Helm

Openstack-Helm is a fully self-contained Helm-based OpenStack deployment on Kubernetes. It will provide baremetal provisioning, persistent storage, full-stack resiliency, scalability, performance monitoring and tracing, and an optional development pipeline (using Jenkins). This project, along with the tools used within are community-based and open sourced.

# Mission

The goal for Openstack-Helm is to provide an incredibly flexible framework for operators and developers alike. It will provide a highly customizable *framework* to deploy a fully functioning Openstack deployment, for both simple and complex environments. Administrators or developers can either deploy all or individual Openstack components along with their required dependancies. It heavily borrows concepts from [Stackanetes](https://github.com/stackanetes/stackanetes) and [other complex Helm application deployments](https://github.com/sapcc/openstack-helm). This project is meant to be a collaborative project that brings Openstack applications into a [Cloud-Native](https://www.cncf.io/about/charter) model.
